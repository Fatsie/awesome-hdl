# Awesome resources for Hardware Description

A curated list of awesome tools, frameworks, IP cores, libraries, and more!

If you miss any project, check the [issues and pull requests](https://github.com/HDL/awesome/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) of this repo. Some proposals might be kept on hold until they get enough reaction from the community. Should it still be missing, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/HDL/awesome/compare)! See [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines about how to clasify new projects.

This repository was created on 2020/02/02 for hopefully merging the content of the following existing lists:

- [vhdl/awesome-vhdl](https://github.com/vhdl/awesome-vhdl)
- [drom/awesome-hdl](https://github.com/drom/awesome-hdl)
- [fukatani/awesome-hdl](https://github.com/fukatani/awesome-hdl)

Later, other awesome lists were added to the scope:

- [ben-marshall/awesome-open-hardware-verification](https://github.com/ben-marshall/awesome-open-hardware-verification)
- [kelu124/awesome-latticeFPGAs](https://github.com/kelu124/awesome-latticeFPGAs)
- [pkuzjx/eda-collection](https://github.com/pkuzjx/eda-collection)
- [Nic30/hdlConvertor#similar-projects](https://github.com/Nic30/hdlConvertor#similar-projects)
- [Nic30/hwt#similar-projects](https://github.com/Nic30/hwt#similar-projects)
- [Nic30/hwtLib#repositories-with-opensource-hw](https://github.com/Nic30/hwtLib#repositories-with-opensource-hw)
- [HardwareIR/netlistDB#similar-libraries](https://github.com/HardwareIR/netlistDB#similar-libraries)
- [rajesh-s/computer-engineering-resources](https://github.com/rajesh-s/computer-engineering-resources/tree/master/area_specific)
- [architecnologia.es/herramientas-electronica](https://architecnologia.es/herramientas-electronica)

However, adding items to hdl/awesome requires slightly more effort, because additional metadata is provided about each project. As a result, some projects from those awesome lists were not added yet.
