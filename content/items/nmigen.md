{{< note >}}
There is/was a dispute between M-Labs and whitequark about the _ownership_ of the brand nMigen. Most of the codebase of nMigen was written by whitequark and the upstream was [nmigen/nmigen](https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen). However, there is a fork in [m-labs/nmigen](https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen) and M-Labs claims the brand as being based on [Migen]({{< ref "/items/migen" >}} "Migen") (see [nmigen.org](https://nmigen.org/)).
