*"gdsfactory is a python library to design chips (Photonics, Analog, Quantum, MEMs, â€¦), objects for 3D printing or PCBs.*

*You can describe your hardware in code (python or YAML), verify it (DRC, simulation, extraction) and validate it (to make sure it meets your specifications after fabrication).."*
